# Plum

**Products. Engineering. Quality. Community.**

Plum introduces a new **IBM Cloud** page. The intent is to advertise what we do, how cool we are, and publicly showcase our teams to job candidates and visitors of our public-facing website.

## Local Preview

Below is a quick "how to" for cloning, installing, and running Plum locally.
