              <p>IBM has a simple vision: "Make the world work better". At IBM Cloud, we play an important role in that vision: We're building the world a place to work.</p>

              <p>The IBM Cloud Development team takes great ideas and turns them into valuable and innovative cloud services. We chart careful courses and forecast advances in technology by incorporating our customers, their needs and desires, into both our planning and the products we offer them. And we use our own platform relentlessly so we can be our harshest critics.</p>

              <p>Ultimately, our mission is simple: "Be the de facto platform on the Internet for cloud-based services".</p>

          <h1>Architecture</h1>

            <p>Architecture is the engine that carries fuzzy ideas and big dreams down the path to realization. We take projects requiring a great deal of synthesis and construct living proofs-of-concept. From there, we line them up with our business and technology strategies, determine whether they can fulfill the demands of our customers, and give our business leaders the power to make key decisions.</p>

          <h3>Our Platform</h3>

            <p>We’re building our platform as a blended solution of different technologies. Its design incorporates a collection of compute, network, storage, and software for mixing-and-matching services. Whether its Virtual Servers, Bare Metal, Block Storage, Private Clouds, or Load Balancing, our platform delivers unmatched scalability and control.</p>

          <h3>Productization</h3>

            <p>Development begins with simple problems; a persistent itch that must be scratched. We explore ideas to scratch that itch by applying strategies that transform them into solutions. Further downstream, we rope in other teams, commit to significant milestones, and groom the project for productization as we ramp-up for a full-blown new product launch.</p>

          <h3>Design</h3>

            <p>Design is instrumental to our success. This is where talented producteers, analyst, and developers experiment with new ideas that steer our strategy. Results are carefully validated, and evaluated, to see how far we should take a project. Our researchers also look to the technological horizons, forecast long-term conditions, identify promising opportunities, and chart courses with the least amount of obstacles.</p>

          <h1>Engineering &amp; Quality</h1>

            <p>Our Engineering and Quality teams stand on the fringes of technology. We survey the chaos beyond the boundaries, chart new directions, carve new pathways, lay foundations, connect the plumbing, and power up new spaces our customers need. We accomplish this with innovative and powerful tools of our own design.</p>

          <h3>Globally Distributed Systems</h3>

            <p>IBM Cloud's approach to offering a global infrastructure inspired us to come up with a more efficient design: a low-latency, high-bandwidth network for running cloud services on a globally distributed system. Our engineers push the boundaries of what's possible by utilizing the global high-performance network, and what we have today is the vertebrae for building highly-available systems with more reliability and better performance compared to alternative systems.</p>

          <h3>Cloud Infrastructure</h3>

            <p>Our cloud infrastructure harnesses a modular architecture with unparalleled scalability and control. This includes a full-featured API and sophisticated automation to control a flexible unified platform that spans physical and virtual devices. Using a combination of quality, feature development, and partnerships, we continuously strive to manage and optimize our core infrastructure for the long-run.</p>

          <h3>Emerging Technology</h3>

            <p>Working at the intersection where technology and business meet means we hunt for new contemporary advances day-in and day-out. Always on the front-line of IBM Cloud's charge toward innovation, our Engineering and Quality teams revolutionize our technological growth and efficiencies through the use of incremental development and convergences. This includes advances in computing, cognitive science, storage, intelligent agents, and more.</p>

          <h1>Community Development</h1>

            <p>Our combustion began at the grassroots level within open source communities. Giving back to those communities allows us to work with a number of creative individuals and keep an eye on what's trending. To date, we have <span id="github-repos"><i class="fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i></span> active open source projects on <a href="http://github.com/softlayer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <!-- <p>Our combustion began at the grassroots level with free, open source software. Not only do we use it, we’re also firm believers in using open development and collaboration to make viable and sustainable products. Contributing back to the open source community allows us to work with a number of creative individuals and keep an eye on what's trending. To date, we have <span id="github-repos"><i class="fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i></span> active open source projects on <a href="http://github.com/softlayer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p> -->

          <h3>Open Source Projects</h3>

            <p>With open source at the helm of our community development, we're pumping out a lot of great projects with help from our contributors.</p>

            <p>For example, <a href="http://softlayer.github.io/jumpgate" target="_blank">Jumpgate</a>, a simple library for making clouds OpenStack-compatible, interfaces with every endpoint on the OpenStack API and shuffles data between the two. Our <a href="http://softlayer.github.io/knife-softlayer" target="_blank">Knife-SoftLayer</a> plugin lets you launch, bootstrap, and manage compute instances in the cloud. And then there's <a href="http://softlayer.github.io/softlayer-python/cli" target="_blank">Python CLI</a>. This little beauty gives you the facilities to spin-up virtual servers and provides seamless access to virtual environments without having to grapple with APIs.</p>

            <p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/softlayer" target="_blank">our projects on GitHub</a> and contribute wherever you can make an impact.</p>

          <h3>Contributing</h3>

            <p>Our workflow follows the  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank">fork-pull model</a> and we leverage issues and pull requests for source control, bug fixes, and new feature development. Anyone is welcome to submit a request. All we ask is that you follow the Contributing Guidelines posted under each of our GitHub repositories.</p>

            <p>We license our code and documentation under the terms of the MIT license. By contributing to any project, you're allowing us to distribute your contribution under the terms of this license.</p>
